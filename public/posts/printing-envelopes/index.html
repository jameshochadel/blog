    </header><p>I needed to print addresses on 40 A7 envelopes today. It&rsquo;s been a while since I printed on anything besides US Letter, and I&rsquo;m unhappy to report that it&rsquo;s no less ridiculous than it was 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Generating the 40 envelopes with mail merge was easy enough. The rest was not:</p>
<ol>
<li>A7 envelopes, at 5.25&quot; tall by 7.25&quot; wide, are not a preconfigured paper size in macOS. I add a new page size with those proportions, but macOS paper settings expect paper to be taller than it is wide, so orienting my new paper size with &ldquo;portrait&rdquo; setting makes it wider than it is tall, and &ldquo;landscape&rdquo; makes it taller than it is wide. I reverse my initial inputs to correct this.</li>
<li>The printer tray has a diagram indicating that paper should be placed face-down, but there&rsquo;s no indication of how to rotate paper that was fed in &ldquo;landscape&rdquo; like mine. With a 50/50 chance of getting it right, the test envelope came out 180ยบ from the correct orientation. Modern macOS print dialogs show all sorts of printer-specific information inline. I wish they went a step further and prompted the user with guidance like, &ldquo;feed paper face-down and with the top edge to the right&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Flipping the envelopes made the address print in the correct orientation, but inexplicably several inches off target. I try several permutations of different margins, page dimensions, portrait/landscape configurations. None print what I see in the print preview.</li>
<li>Reasoning that the printer can print on letter paper, and knowing where envelopes feed into the printer relative to a sheet of letter paper, I reformat the entire document to the dimensions of a letter page, with the addresses superimposed. I print one to test, and it works!</li>
<li>Victory, right? I print the rest. The first envelope in the batch prints wildly off target, mostly off the page, and then the printer stops due to a media error.</li>
<li>I resort to opening the print dialog 40 times in a row, printing one page at a time each time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Final step: Contemplate whether hand-addressing the envelopes would have been quicker.</p>
<hr>
<p>Post script: I said that mail merge itself was easy, but I forgot that it actually was not. I tried doing the merge in Apple Pages, and per the Pages help website, there should have been a button under the Document tab in the sidebar to configure mail merge. The button was not there, and the help page gave no hints about how to make it appear. I ended up recreating the layout in Word.</p>
